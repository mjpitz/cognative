# -- Details

name: cognative-s3
description: |
  cognative is an opinionated, minimalistic approach to business intelligence ðŸ§  and operations ðŸš¨. We strongly believe
  companies should be able to own their own data, and many solutions out there leave organizations to the whims of 
  third-party providers. Our goal is to reduce the complexity of traditional business intelligence and operations 
  stacks, while seeking to maximize the efforts of everyday operations staff. This not only simplifies the process for 
  operators, but also enhances the experience for less infrastructure-aware developers.
  
  (BETA) This chart provides an early access preview to the cogantive stack. It currently not suitable for production.
  I'm hoping to iterate on this stack in the public, and am actively looking for help from others to push it forward.
