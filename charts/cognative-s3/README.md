cognative is an opinionated, minimalistic approach to business intelligence ðŸ§  and operations ðŸš¨. We strongly believe
companies should be able to own their own data, and many solutions out there leave organizations to the whims of
third-party providers. Our goal is to reduce the complexity of traditional business intelligence and operations
stacks, while seeking to maximize the efforts of everyday operations staff. This not only simplifies the process for
operators, but also enhances the experience for less infrastructure-aware developers.

(BETA) This chart provides an early access preview to the cogantive stack. It currently not suitable for production.
I'm hoping to iterate on this stack in the public, and am actively looking for help from others to push it forward.

> Unlike the base [cognative][] chart, this chart demonstrates how you can tier data storage using S3. ClickHouse
> supports a variety of storage mechanisms, so be sure to consult the docs on how you can leverage your preferred
